<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p> <strong>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</strong> It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p><em>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans) <br>
175g of tahini <br>
6 sundried tomatoes <br>
Half a red pepper <br>
A pinch of cayenne pepper <br>
    1 clove of garlic <br>
    A dash of olive oil <br> </em>
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

 <!--comment -- >scemo chi legge </--comment-->

<p> Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely <br>
Add all the ingredients into a food processor <br>
Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br>
If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time <br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time <br> </p>

<p> For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. <br>
    <br>
    Experiment and see what works for you. </p>

<h2> Storage </h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p> <br>

<p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months. </p> <br>
